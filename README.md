## ‚ú® Trigger.dev GitHub Issues to Slack

This repo contains a [GitHub IssueEvent](https://docs.trigger.dev/integrations/apis/github/events/issues) Trigger that will run Trigger a workflow whenever an issue action is performed in a GitHub repository:

```ts
import { Trigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import * as github from "@trigger.dev/github";
import * as slack from "@trigger.dev/slack";

const repo =
  process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY ?? "triggerdotdev/github-issues-to-slack";

new Trigger({
  // Give your Trigger a stable ID
  id: "github-issues-to-slack",
  name: "Posts to Slack when a GitHub Issue is created or modified",
  // This will register a webhook with the repo
  // and trigger whenever a new issue is created or modified
  on: github.events.issueEvent({
    repo,
  }),
  // The run function will get called once per "issue" event
  // See https://docs.trigger.dev/integrations/apis/github/events/issues
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    // Posts a new message to the "github-issues" slack channel.
    // See https://docs.trigger.dev/integrations/apis/slack/actions/post-message
    // If the channel is private, you'll need to add the Trigger.dev bot to the channel first.
    const response = await slack.postMessage("send-to-slack", {
      channelName: "github-issues",
      // If you include blocks, this text will be used in any notifications.
      text: `GitHub issue, *${event.issue.title}* has been *${event.action}*. `,
      // Blocks allow you to create richly formatted messages.
      // See https://api.slack.com/tools/block-kit-builder
      blocks: [
        {
          type: "section",
          text: {
            type: "mrkdwn",
            text: `GitHub issue, *${event.issue.title}* has been *${event.action}*.`,
          },
          accessory: {
            type: "button",
            text: {
              type: "plain_text",
              text: "View Issue",
              emoji: true,
            },
            value: "View Issue",
            url: event.issue.html_url,
            action_id: "button-action",
          },
        },
      ],
    });
  },
}).listen();
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Customize

1. Make sure and update the `repo` parameter to point to a GitHub repository you manage by setting the `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` environment variable.
2. Feel free to customize [postMessage](https://docs.trigger.dev/integrations/apis/slack/actions/post-message) call with more data from the [GitHub IssueEvent](https://docs.trigger.dev/integrations/apis/github/events/issues) and change the channel name.

## üíª Run locally

First, in your terminal of choice, clone the repo and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/triggerdotdev/github-issues-to-slack.git
cd github-issues-to-slack
npm install
```

Then create a `.env` file at the root of the repository (it's already gitignored) with your development Trigger.dev API Key and GITHUB_REPOSITORY:

```
TRIGGER_API_KEY=<your api key>
GITHUB_REPOSITORY=<your github repository> # e.g. triggerdotdev/trigger.dev
```

And finally you are ready to run the process:

```sh
npm run dev
```

You should see a message like the following:

```
[trigger.dev]  ‚ú® Connected and listening for events [github-issues-to-slack]
```
